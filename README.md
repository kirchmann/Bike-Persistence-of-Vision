# Bike-Persistence-of-Vision

LEDs were set on the spokes of the bike wheel and were be turned on and off so that an image was displayed if the wheel was seen from a distance. It appeared as there are multiple rows of LEDs that are shining. The speed of the bike had have to be high enough for the persistence of vision effect to be visible. A hall effect sensor was used to count the time for the wheel to do one rotation.
